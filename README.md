A full list of the 1000+ Material Design Icons icons is available: [materialdesignicons.com/](http://materialdesignicons.com/)

##Usage Instructions

To use any of the Material Design icons on your WordPress site you have two options:

__HTML__

**Examples**

Bell icon

`<i class="mdi mdi-bell"></i>`


__Shortcode__

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Material Design icon.

The shortcode to use is `[mdi-icon name=X]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**

Amazon icon

`[mdi-icon name="amazon"]`

With v0.0.3 you can now add size and color.

`[mdi-icon name="amazon" color="red" size="2x"]`

You can add a hex color value and the include size values are: lg, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x

##Installation

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Use one of the two usage methods (HTML or Shortcode) within the content of your posts or pages.
